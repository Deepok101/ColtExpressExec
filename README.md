# Colt Express Executable

Durring the academic year of 2020-2021, I worked with a team of 5 developers on a Windows and Mac implementation of the Colt Express board game with Unity.

Please note that this repo does not contain any code. The actual respository with the code is within a McGill University orgainization and thus we cannot make it public.

## How to play

This repository contains the game executable for Windows and Mac in the releases section. You can download your prefered platform executable in the releases section of this repo.

Note: While the game is downloadable, you will not be able to play the game because there is no deployed server online. The game depends on a connection to a server and a microservice. For security and monetary reasons, we will not deploy these servers but will post screenshots of our game shortly!
